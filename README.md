# CISE-SPEED

SPEED is a web page developed as part of a university project for the paper Contemporary Issues in Software Engineering. It uses mongoDB, React, Express and Node.js 

## Installation

To install and run this application locally you will need to create an account with mongoDB and set up a cluster to act as your database. 

Once you have set up your mongoDB you will need to create a .env file in the root directory and include your
mongoDB driver code as shown below.

With mongoDB set up create two separate terminals to run the frontend and backend components.

In the first terminal navigate to the backend directory. \
From the backend directory \
run npm install \
npm start 

In the second terminal navigate to the frontend directory. \
From the frontend directory \

npm start 

The application is now launched and connected to your databse enjoy :)
